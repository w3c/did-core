A "did" URI is used to express an identifier that is conformant to the
Decentralized Identifier[1] specification. The specification details how
identifiers conformant to the "did" URI Scheme can be implemented using
decentralized ledgers, decentralized hashtables, and other types of

Community Group and is expected to transition to the W3C standards track
at the end of 2018 or early 2019 calendar year.
