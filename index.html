    <p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies. These new
identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove
control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. <a>DID</a>s are URLs that associate
a <a>DID subject</a> with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject. Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic
material, verification methods, or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a set
of mechanisms enabling a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions associated with
the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID document</a> might contain semantics about the
subject that it identifies. A <a>DID document</a> might contain the <a>DID
subject</a> itself (e.g. a data model).
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.

    <h1>
Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). Resources on the Internet are identified by globally
unique identifiers in the form of <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr>
addresses; URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for resources on the Web
and each web page you view in a browser has a globally unique URL (Uniform
Resource Locator).
    </p>
    <p>
The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
identify and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
and recognized only by certain bodies (not of our choosing). They may disappear
or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They may unnecessarily
reveal personal information. And in many cases they can be fraudulently
replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party ("identity theft").
    </p>
    <p>
The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate our own identifiers using systems we trust, and to
prove control of those identifiers (authenticate) using cryptographic proofs
(for example, digital signatures, privacy-preserving biometric protocols, and so
on).
    </p>
    <p>
Because we control the generation and assertion of these identifiers, each of us
can have as many DIDs as we need to respect our desired separation of
identities, personas, and contexts (in the everyday sense of these words). We
can scope the use of these identifiers to the most appropriate contexts. We can
interact with other people, institutions or systems that require us to identify
ourselves (or things we control) while maintaining control over how much
personal or private data should be revealed, and without depending on a central
authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification does not require any particular technology or cryptography to
underpin the generation, persistence, resolution or interpretation of DIDs.
Rather, it defines: a) the generic syntax for all DIDs, and b) the generic
requirements for performing the four basic CRUD operations (create, read,
update, deactivate) on the metadata associated with a DID (called the DID
document).
    </p>
    <p>
This enables implementers to design specific types of DIDs to work with the
computing infrastructure they trust (e.g., blockchain, distributed ledger,
decentralized file system, distributed database, peer-to-peer network). The
specification for a specific type of DID is called a DID method. Implementers of
applications or systems using DIDs can choose to support the DID methods most
appropriate for their particular use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
This specification is for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Developers who want to enable users of their system to generate and assert their
own identifiers (producers of DIDs);
      </li>
      <li>
Developers who want to enable their systems to accept user-controlled
identifiers (consumers of DIDs);
      </li>
      <li>
Developers who wish to enable the use of DIDs with particular computing
infrastructure (DID method developers).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note" title="Diversity of DID systems">
DID methods can also be developed for identifiers registered in federated or
centralized identity management systems. Indeed, almost all types of identifier
systems can add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability bridge
between the worlds of centralized, federated, and decentralized identifiers.

      <dl>
        <dt>
DIDs and DID URLs
        </dt>
        <dd>
A <a>DID</a>, or Decentralized Identifier, is a URI composed of three parts: the
scheme "did:", a method identifier, and a unique, method-specific identifier
generated by the <a>DID method</a>. DIDs are resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>.
A <a>DID URL</a> extends the syntax of a basic DID to incorporate other standard
URI components (path, query, fragment) in order to locate a particular
resource&mdash;for example, a public key inside a <a>DID document</a>, or a
resource available external to the <a>DID document</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Subjects
        </dt>
        <dd>
The subject of a <a>DID</a> is, by definition, the entity identified by the
<a>DID</a>. The <a>DID subject</a> may also be the <a>DID controller</a>.
Anything can be the subject of a DID: person, group, organization, physical
thing, logical thing, etc.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Controllers
        </dt>
        <dd>
The <a>controller</a> of a <a>DID</a> is the entity (person, organization, or
autonomous software) that has the capability&mdash;as defined by a <a>DID
method</a>&mdash;to make changes to a <a>DID document</a>. This capability is
typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
software acting on behalf of the controller, though it may also be asserted via
other mechanisms. Note that a DID may have more than one controller, and the
controller(s) may include the <a>DID subject</a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
Verifiable Data Registries
        </dt>
        <dd>
In order to be resolvable to <a>DID documents</a>, <a>DIDs</a> are typically
recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
specific technology used, any such system that supports recording DIDs and
returning data necessary to produce <a>DID documents</a> is called a
<a>verifiable data registry</a>. Examples include distributed ledgers,
decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
other forms of trusted data storage.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID documents
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID documents</a> contain metadata associated with a <a>DID</a>. They
typically express verification methods (such as public keys) and services
relevant to interactions with the DID subject. A DID document is serialized
according to a particular syntax (see <a href="#core-representations"></a>). The
<a>DID</a> itself is the value of the `id` property. The generic properties
supported in a DID document are specified in <a href="#core-properties"></a>.
The properties present in a DID document may be updated according to the
applicable operations outlined in <a href="#methods"></a>.
        </dd>

        <dt>
DID Methods
        </dt>
        <dd>
<a>DID methods</a> are the mechanism by which a particular type of <a>DID</a>
and its associated <a>DID document</a> are created, resolved, updated, and
deactivated using a particular <a>verifiable data registry</a>. <a>DID
methods</a> are defined using separate DID method specifications (see
<a href="#methods"></a>).

          <p class="note">
Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a <a>DID
method</a> specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
<a>URI</a> specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]] (such as the http: and https: schemes specified in
[[RFC7230]]). It is also similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
URN specification ([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition, (such
as the <a>UUID</a> URN namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that
a DID method specification, as well as defining a specific DID scheme, also
specifies the methods creating, resolving, updating, and deactivating
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> using a specific type of <a>verifiable data
registry</a>.

        <dt>
DID resolvers and DID resolution
        </dt>
        <dd>
A <a>DID resolver</a> is a software and/or hardware component that takes a
<a>DID</a> (and associated options) as input and produces a conforming <a>DID
document</a> (and associated metadata) as output. This process is called <a>DID
resolution</a>. The inputs and outputs of the DID resolution process are defined
in <a href="#resolution"></a>. The specific steps for resolving a specific type
of DID are defined by the relevant <a>DID method</a> specification. Additional
considerations for implementing a DID resolver are discussed in
[[DID-RESOLUTION]].

        <dt>
DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing
        </dt>
        <dd>
A <a>DID URL</a> dereferencer is a software and/or hardware component that takes
a DID URL (and associated options) as input and produces a resource (and
associated metadata) as output. This process is called DID URL dereferencing.
The inputs and outputs of the DID URL dereferencing process are defined in <a
href="#did-url-dereferencing"></a>. Additional considerations for implementing a
DID URL dereferencer are discussed in [[DID-RESOLUTION]].

This document contains examples that contain JSON, CBOR, and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (<code>//</code>) and the use of ellipsis (<code>...</code>) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON, CBOR,
or JSON-LD.

      <p>
Interoperability of implementations for DIDs and DID documents will be tested by
evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a> that conform to the specification. Interoperability for
producers and consumers of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> is provided by
ensuring the <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> conform. Interoperability for
<a>DID method</a> specifications is provided by the details in each DID method
specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web browser is not
required to implement all known URI schemes, conformant software that works with
DIDs is not required to implement all known DID methods (however, all
implementations of a given DID method must be interoperable for that method).

        <h2>Persistence</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> is expected to be persistent and immutable. That is, a <a>DID</a>
is bound exclusively and permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a
<a>DID</a> is deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
Ideally, a <a>DID</a> would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier
(like a <a>UUID</a>) that could be bound to multiple underlying <a>verifiable
data registries</a> over time, thus maintaining its persistence independent of
any particular system. However, registering the same identifier on multiple
<a>verifiable data registries</a> introduces extremely hard entityship and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA">
start-of-authority</a> (SOA) problems. It also greatly increases implementation
complexity for developers.
          </p>
          <p>
To avoid these issues, developers should refer to the Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] to decide which <a>DID method</a> best
addresses the needs of the use case.

Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification
might support a <a>DID document</a> <code>equivID</code> property to establish
verifiable equivalence relations between <a>DIDs</a> representing the same
subject on multiple <a>verifiable data registries</a>. Such equivalence relations can
produce the practical equivalent of a single persistent abstract <a>DID</a>.

      <h3>DID URL Syntax</h3>

      <section>
        <h2>Generic DID URL Syntax</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID URL</a> always identifies a <a>resource</a> to be located. It can be
used, for example, to identify a specific part of a <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
This following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5324]]. It
builds on the <code>did</code> scheme defined in <a
href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>. The <code>path-abempty</code> and
<code>fragment</code> components are identical to the ABNF rules defined in
[[!RFC3986]], and the <code>did-query</code> component is derived from the
<code>query</code> ABNF rule.
        </p>


        <pre class="nohighlight">
did-url            = did path-abempty [ "?" did-query ]
                     [ "#" fragment ]
did-query          = param *( "&" param )
param              = param-name "=" param-value
param-name         = 1*pchar
param-value        = *pchar

        <p>
This specification reserves the semicolon (<code>;</code>) character for
possible future use as a sub-delimiter for parameters as described in
[[?MATRIX-URIS]].

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Generic DID URL Parameters</h2>

        <p>
The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters
based on the query component (See <a href="#query"></a>). The ABNF above
specifies the basic syntax (the <code>param</code> rule) but does not specify
any concrete parameter names.
        </p>
        <p>
Some generic DID parameter names (for example, for service selection) are
completely independent of any specific <a>DID method</a> and MUST always
function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID parameter names (for
example, for versioning) MAY be supported by certain <a>DID methods</a>, but
MUST operate uniformly across those <a>DID methods</a> that do support them.
        </p>
        <p>
Parameter names that are completely method-specific are described in Section
<a href="#method-specific-parameters"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names.
        </p>

            <tr>
              <td>
<code>version-id</code>
              </td>
              <td>
Identifies a specific version of a <a>DID document</a> to be resolved (the
version ID could be sequential, or a <a>UUID</a>, or method-specific). Note that
this parameter might not be supported by all <a>DID methods</a>.
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>
<code>version-time</code>
              </td>
              <td>
Identifies a certain version timestamp of a <a>DID document</a> to be resolved.
That is, the <a>DID document</a> that was valid for a <a>DID</a> at a certain
time. Note that this parameter might not be supported by all <a>DID methods</a>.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
Additional considerations for processing these parameters are discussed in
[?DID-RESOLUTION].
        </p>

        <p>
Two example <a>DID URLs</a> using the <code>service</code> and
<code>version-time</code> generic DID parameters are shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID URL with a 'service' DID parameter">
did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?service=agent
        </pre>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID URL with a 'version-time' DID parameter">
did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?version-time=2002-10-10T17:00:00Z
        </pre>

        <p>
Adding a DID parameter to a <a>DID URL</a> means that the parameter becomes part
of an identifier for a <a>resource</a> (the <a>DID document</a> or other).
Alternatively, the <a>DID resolution</a> and the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a>
functions can also be influenced by passing input metadata to a <a>DID
resolver</a> that are not part of the DID URL. (See <a
href="#metadata-structure"></a>). Such options could for example control caching
or the desired encoding of a resolution result. This is comparable to HTTP,
where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the <a>DID URL</a>
should be used to specify <i>what <a>resource</a> is being identified</i>,
whereas <a>DID resolution</a> options that are not part of the <a>DID URL</a>
should be use to control <i>how that <a>resource</a> is resolved or
dereferenced</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters MAY be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a URI that can be used as a link, or as a <a>resource</a> in
RDF / JSON-LD documents.
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if there are already other, equivalent ways of
constructing URIs that fulfill the same purpose (for example, using other
syntactical constructs such as URI query strings or URI fragments).
        </p>

        <p>
DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if the same functionality can be expressed by
passing options to a <a>DID resolver</a>, and if there is no need to construct a
URI for use as a link, or as a <a>resource</a> in RDF / JSON-LD documents.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Method-Specific DID URL Parameters</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify additional method-specific
parameter names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method
name, as defined by the <code>method-name</code> rule.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, if the method <code>did:foo:</code> defines the parameter bar, the
parameter name must be <code>foo:bar</code>. An example <a>DID URL</a> using
this method and this method-specific parameter would be as shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:bar=high
        </pre>

        <p>
A method-specific parameter name defined by one <a>DID method</a> MAY be used by
other <a>DID methods</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:bar=low
        </pre>

        <p>
Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter names in
any order.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?service=agent&amp;foo:bar=high
        </pre>

        <p>
Both <a>DID method</a> namespaces and method-specific parameter namespaces MAY
include colons, so they might be partitioned hierarchically, as defined by a
<a>DID method</a> specification. The following example <a>DID URL</a>
illustrates both.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:foo:baz:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:baz:hex=b612
        </pre>

        <p class="issue" data-number="36">
Review what exactly we want to say about method-specific parameters
defined by one method but used in a <a>DID URL</a> with a different method.
Also discuss hierarchical method namespaces in DID parameter names.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Path</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID path</a> is identical to a generic URI path and MUST conform to the
<code>path-abempty</code> ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A <a>DID path</a> SHOULD be
used to address <a>resources</a> available through a <a>service endpoint</a>.
For more information, see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID paths</a> that
are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:123456/path
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Query</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID query</a> is derived from a generic URI query and MUST conform to the
<code>did-query</code> ABNF rule in Section <a href="#generic-did-url-syntax">
</a>. If a <a>DID query</a> is present, it MUST be used
as described in Sections <a href="#generic-did-url-parameters"></a> and
<a href="#method-specific-did-url-parameters"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID queries</a> that
are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:123456?query=true
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fragment</h2>

        <p>
A <a>DID fragment</a> is used as method-independent reference into the <a>DID
document</a> to identify a component of the document (for example, a unique
<a>public key description</a> or <a>service endpoint</a>). <a>DID fragment</a>
syntax and semantics are identical to a generic URI fragment and  MUST conform
to <a data-cite="RFC3986#section-3.5">RFC&nbsp;3986, section 3.5</a>. To
dereference a <a>DID fragment</a>, the complete <a>DID URL</a> including the
<a>DID fragment</a> MUST be used as input to the <a>DID URL dereferencing</a>
function for the target component in the <a>DID document</a> object. For more
information, see <a href="#did-url-dereferencing"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID fragments</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:123456#public-key-1
        </pre>

        <p>
In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
<a>DID fragments</a> are interpreted in the same way across representations (as
described in <a href="#core-representations"></a>). For example, while
JSON Pointer [[?RFC6901]] can be used in a <a>DID fragment</a>, it will not
be interpreted in the same way across representations.
        </p>

        <p>
Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
representations in Section <a href="#application-did-ld-json"></a>.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Relative DID URLs</h2>

        <p>
A relative DID URL is any URL value in a <a>DID document</a> that does not start
with <code>did:&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>. More
specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined  in
Section <a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>. The contents of the URL typically
refers to a <a>resource</a> in the same <a>DID document</a>. Relative DID URLs
MAY contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment
identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
When resolving a relative DID URL reference, the algorithm specified in <a
data-cite="RFC3986#section-5">RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution</a>  MUST
be used. The <strong>base URI</strong> value is the <a>DID</a> that is
associated with the <a>DID subject</a>, see Section <a href="#did-subject"></a>.
The <strong>scheme</strong> is <code>did</code>. The <strong>authority</strong>
is a combination of <code>&lt;method-name>:&lt;method-specific-id></code>, and
the <strong>path</strong>, <strong>query</strong>, and <strong>fragment</strong>
values are those defined in Section <a href="#path"></a>, Section <a
href="#query"></a>, and Section <a href="#fragment"></a>, respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
Relative DID URLs are often used to identify <a>verification methods</a> and
<a>services</a> in a DID Document without having to use absolute URLs, which
tend to be more verbose than necessary.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="An example of a relative DID URL">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> consists of a collection of property-value pairs. The

      <h2>Representations</h2>
      <p>
Following are the requirements for representations.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
A representation MUST define an unambiguous encoding and decoding of all
properties and their associated values as defined in this specification. This
means anything you can represent in the <a>DID document</a> data model can be
represented in any compliant representation.
        </li>
        <li>
The representation MUST be associated with an IANA-registered MIME type.
        </li>
        <li>
The representation MUST define fragment processing rules for its MIME type that
are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in section
<a href="#fragment"></a> of this specification.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The data model supports two types of extensibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the official
W3C DID Core Registries mechanism [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. The use of this
mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified method
that ensures that two different representations will be able to work together.
        </li>
      <li>
Representations MAY define other extensibility mechanisms including methods for
decentralized extensions. Such extension mechanisms MUST support lossless
conversion into any other conformant representation.
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">
It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or representation that is not recorded in
the DID Core Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]; interoperability between such
implementations and the larger ecosystem will be less reliable.
      </p>

    <h1>Core Properties</h1>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> points to a <a>DID document</a>. <a>DID documents</a> are the
serialization of the data model outlined in Section <a href="#data-model"></a>.
The following sections define the properties in a <a>DID document</a>,
including whether these properties are required or optional.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
Identifiers
      </h2>
      <p>
Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of people,
organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general. Identifiers are
typically URLs, or more generally, <a>URIs</a>. Non-<a>URI</a>-based identifiers
are not advised because, while the data model supports them, they are not easy
to use with other Internet-based identifiers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>DID Subject</h2>

      <p>
The <a>DID subject</a> is denoted with the <code>id</code> property. The
<a>DID subject</a> is the entity that the <a>DID document</a> is about. That is,
it is the entity identified by the <a>DID</a> and described by the
<a>DID document</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>DID documents</a> MUST include the <code>id</code> property.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>id</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
The value of <code>id</code> MUST be a single valid <a>DID</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
  "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp"
}
      </pre>

      <p class="note">
<a>DID method</a> specifications can create intermediate representations of a
<a>DID document</a> that do not contain the <code>id</code> key, such as when a
<a>DID resolver</a> is performing <a>DID resolution</a>. However, the fully
resolved <a>DID document</a> always contains a valid <code>id</code> property.
The value of <code>id</code> in the resolved <a>DID document</a> is expected to
match the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verification Methods</h2>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express <a>verification methods</a>, such as
cryptographic keys, which can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions
with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated parties. The information expressed
often includes globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material, which
can be used to verify digital signatures. For example, a public key can be
used as a verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such
usage, it verifies that the signer possessed the associated private key.
      </p>
      <p>
Verification methods might take many parameters. An example of this is a set
of five cryptographic keys from which any three are required to contribute to
a threshold signature. Methods need not be cryptographic. An example of this
might be the contact information for a biometric service provider that compares
a purported <a>DID controller</a> against a candidate biometric vector.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a <code>verificationMethod</code> property.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>verificationMethod</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
If a <a>DID document</a> includes a <code>verificationMethod</code> property,
the value of the property MUST be an array of verification method objects.
Each verification method object MUST have the <code>id</code>, <code>type</code>,
<code>controller</code>, and specific verification method properties. The
verification method objects MAY include additional properties.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a>. The array of
verification methods MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same
<code>id</code>. If the array of <a>verification methods</a> contains multiple
entries with the same <code>id</code>, a <a>DID document</a> processor MUST
produce an error.
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be exactly one verification
method type. In order to maximize global interoperability, the
<a>verification method</a> type SHOULD be registered in the
[[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>controller</code> property, MUST be a valid <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
In order to maximize global interoperability, the verification method properties
SHOULD be registered in the [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

    <section>
      <h2>Public Keys</h2>

      <p>
A public key is a <a>verification method</a>.
Public keys are used for digital signatures, encryption and other cryptographic
operations, which in turn are the basis for purposes such as authentication
(see Section <a href="#authentication"></a>) or establishing secure
communication with <a>service endpoints</a> (see Section
<a href="#service-endpoints"></a>). As well, public keys can play a role in
authorization mechanisms of <a>DID</a> method operations (see Section
<a href="#method-operations"></a>), which can be defined by <a>DID method</a>
specifications.
      </p>

      <p>
Public keys can be included in a <a>DID document</a> using the
<code>publicKey</code> or <code>authentication</code> properties, depending on
what they are to be used for. Each public key has an identifier (<code>id</code>)
of its own, a <code>type</code>, and a <code>controller</code>, as well as
other properties that depend on the type of key it is.
      </p>

      <p>
This specification strives to limit the number of formats for expressing public
key material in a DID Document to the fewest possible, to increase the
likelihood of interoperability. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment. The specific
types of key formats that are supported in this specification are listed below.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a <code>publicKey</code> property.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>publicKey</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
If a <a>DID document</a> includes a <code>publicKey</code> property, the value
of the property MUST be an array of public key objects. Each public key object
MUST have the <code>type</code>, <code>controller</code>, and specific public
key properties, and MUST have an <code>id</code> property. The public key
objects MAY include additional properties.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a>. The array of
public keys MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same <code>id</code>. In
this case, a <a>DID document</a> processor MUST produce an error.
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be exactly one public key type.
For a registry of available key types and formats, see [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>controller</code> property, which identifies the
controller of the corresponding private key, MUST be a valid <a>DID</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="note" title="Key controller(s) and DID controller(s)">
The semantics of the <code>controller</code> property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the <a>DID document</a> as when the subject
of the relationship is a key. Since a key can't control itself, and the
key controller cannot be inferred from the <a>DID document</a>, it is
necessary to explicitly express the identity of the controller of the key
(which may be the <a>DID controller</a> or <a>DID subject</a>). The
difference is that the value of <code>controller</code> on a key is not
necessarily a <a>DID controller</a>. <a>DID controller(s)</a> are
expressed using the <code>controller</code> property on the top level of
the <a>DID document</a>; see Section
<a href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MAY be structured as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key">compound key</a>. This is
especially useful for integrating with existing key management systems and key
formats such as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>. It is
RECOMMENDED that <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>
<code>kid</code> values are set to the
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638">public key fingerprint</a>. It is
RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use JWKs to represent their public
keys utilize the value of <code>kid</code> as their fragment identifier. See the
first key in <a href="#example-15-various-public-keys">EXAMPLE 15</a> for an
example of a public key with a compound key identifier.
      </p>

      <p>
All public key properties MUST be registered in the [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <p>
If a public key does not exist in the <a>DID document</a>, it MUST be assumed
the key was revoked or is invalid.
The <a>DID document</a> MUST NOT express revoked keys using a
<a>verification relationship</a>.
Each
<a>DID method</a> specification is expected to detail how revocation is
performed and tracked.
      </p>

      <p>
Public keys of all types MUST be expressed in either JSON Web Key (JWK) format
using the <code>publicKeyJwk</code> property or one of the formats listed in the
table below. Public key expression MUST NOT use any other key format.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
The Working Group is still debating whether the base encoding format used will
be Base58 (Bitcoin) [[BASE58]], base64url [[RFC7515]], or base16 (hex)

Let <em>value</em> be the data associated with the <code>publicKey</code>
property and initialize <em>result</em> to <code>null</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is an object, the key material is embedded. Set
<em>result</em> to <em>value</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is a string, the key is included by reference. Assume
<em>value</em> is a URL.
          <ol>
            <li>
Dereference the URL and retrieve the <code>publicKey</code> properties
associated with the URL. For example, process the <code>publicKey</code>
property at the top-level of the dereferenced document.
            </li>

            <li>
Iterating through each public key object, if the <code>id</code> property of the
object matches <em>value</em>, set <em>result</em> to the object.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>result</em> does not contain at least the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, and <code>controller</code> properties, as well as any
mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the <code>type</code>
property of <em>result</em>, throw an error.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">
Caching and expiration of the keys in a <a>DID document</a> is entirely the

      <h2>
Authorization and Delegation
      </h2>

      <p>
Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations are performed
on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>. Delegation is the mechanism that the
subject uses to authorize others to act on their behalf.
      </p>

      <p class="note" title="Authorization vs authentication">
Note that Authorization is separate from <a href="#authentication"></a>.
This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of key loss,
when the subject no longer has access to their keys, or key compromise,
where the <a>DID controller</a>'s trusted third parties need to override
malicious activity by an attacker. See Section
<a href="#security-considerations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
A DID document MAY include a <code>controller</code> property to indicate
that there are <a>DID controller(s)</a> other than the <a>DID subject</a>.
If so:
      </p>

      <dl>
          <dt><dfn>controller</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>controller</code> property MUST be a valid <a>DID</a>
or an array of valid <a>DIDs</a>. The corresponding <a>DID document</a>(s)
SHOULD contain <a>verification relationships</a> that explicitly permit the
use of certain verification methods for specific purposes.
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
Each <a>DID method</a> MUST define how authorization and delegation are
implemented, including any necessary cryptographic operations.
      </p>

      <p>
There are at least two suggested methods for implementing Authorization and
Delegation, which may be layered:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
A <a>verifiable data registry</a> could implement a coarse-grained
<code>controller</code> pattern by enabling <a>DID documents</a> to express
the <a>DID</a> of another <a>DID controller</a> that controls it, or
additionally,
        </li>

        <li>
A <a>verifiable data registry</a> could implement a capabilities-based
approach enabling further fine-grained control of authorization and
delegation.

      <h2>Verification Relationships</h2>

      <p>
A <a>verification relationship</a> expresses the relationship between the
<a>DID subject</a> and a <a>verification method</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a property expressing a specific
<a>verification relationship</a>. In order to maximize global
interoperability, the property SHOULD be registered in
[[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>
      <p>
A <a>DID controller</a> MUST be explicit about the <a>verification
relationship</a> between the <a>DID subject</a> and the
<a>verification method</a>.
<a>Verification methods</a> that are not associated with a particular
<a>verification relationship</a> MUST NOT be used for that <a>verification
relationship</a>. See the sections below for more detailed examples of a
<a>verification relationship</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>authentication</h3>

        <p>
Authentication is a <a>verification relationship</a> which an entity can use
to prove it is the <a>DID subject</a> or acting on behalf of the
<a>DID Subject</a> as a <a>DID Controller</a>. The <em>verifier</em> of an
authentication attempt can check if the authenticating party is presenting a
valid proof of authentication, that is, that they are who they say they are.
Note that a successful authentication on its own might or might not confer
authority; that is up to the verifying application.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Uses of authentication">
If authentication is established, it is up to the <a>DID method</a> or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular <a>DID
method</a> could decide that authenticating as a <a>DID controller</a> is
sufficient to, for example, update or delete the <a>DID document</a>. Another
<a>DID method</a> could require different keys, or a different verification
method entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the <a>DID
document</a> than that used to authenticate. In other words, what is done
<em>after</em> the authentication check is out of scope for the DID data
model, but <a>DID methods</a> and applications are expected to define this
themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include an <code>authentication</code> property.
The <code>authentication</code> property is an example of a <a>verification
relationship</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>authentication</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>authentication</code> property is a relationship between the <a>DID
subject</a> and a set of verification methods (such as, but not limited to,
public keys). It means that the <a>DID subject</a> has authorized some set of
<a>verification methods</a> (per the value of the <code>authentication</code>
property) for the purpose of authentication. The value of the
<code>authentication</code> property SHOULD be an array of <a>verification
methods</a>. Each <a>verification method</a> MAY be embedded or referenced. An
example of a <a>verification method</a> is a public key
(see Section <a href="#public-keys"></a>).
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
This statement is useful to any <em>authentication verifier</em> that needs
to check to see if an entity that is attempting to authenticate is, in fact,
presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a <em>verifier</em> receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was
made for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is
identified by the <a>DID</a>, then that <em>verifier</em> checks to ensure
that the proof can be verified using a <a>verification method</a> (e.g.,
public key) listed under <code>authentication</code> in the
<a>DID Document</a>.

        <p>
The <a>verification method</a> indicated by the <code>authentication</code>
property of a <a>DID document</a> can only be used to authenticate the
<a>DID subject</a>. To authenticate the <a>DID controller</a> (in cases
where the <a>DID controller</a> is not <em>also</em> the <a>DID subject</a>)
the entity associated with the value of <code>controller</code> (see
Section <a href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>) needs to
authenticate itself with its <em>own</em> <a>DID document</a> and attached
<code>authentication</code> <a>verification relationship</a>.

        <h3>assertionMethod</h3>
        <p>
The <code>assertionMethod</code> property is used to express a <a>verification
relationship</a> which indicates that a <a>verification method</a> can be
used to assert a statement on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>. The
<em>verifier</em> of an <code>assertionMethod</code> attempt can check proof
of a statement asserted on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a> by checking if
the <a>verification method</a> used with the proof is contained in the
<code>assertionMethod</code> of the <a>DID Document</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="Uses of assertionMethod">
If <code>assertionMethod</code> is established, it is up to the
verifier to validate that the <a>verification method</a> used for
providing proof of an assertion is valid and is associated with the
<code>assertionMethod</code> <a>verification relationship</a>. An example of
when this property is useful is during the processing of a verifiable
credential by a verifier. During validation, a verifier
checks to see if a verifiable credential has been signed by the <a>DID

          <p>
The <code>keyAgreement</code> property is used to express a
<a>verification relationship</a> which an entity can use to engage in key
agreement protocols on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>. The
<em>counterparties</em> in a key agreement protocol can use the
<code>keyAgreement</code> <a>verification relationship</a> to check whether a
party performing a key agreement protocol on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>
is authorized by checking if the <a>verification method</a> used during the

The <code>capabilityInvocation</code> property is used to express a
<a>verification relationship</a> which an entity can use to invoke
capabilities as the <a>DID subject</a> or on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>.
A capability is an expression of an action that the <a>DID subject</a> is
authorized to take. The <em>verifier</em> of a capability invocation attempt
can check the validity of a capability by checking if the
<a>verification method</a> used with the proof is contained in the

their capability to start a vehicle through the combined usage of a

      <h2>Service Endpoints</h2>

      <p>
<a>Service endpoints</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways of
communicating with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities. Services
listed in the <a>DID document</a> can contain information about privacy
preserving messaging services, or more public information, such as social media
accounts, personal websites, and email addresses although this is discouraged.
See <a href="#keep-personally-identifiable-information-pii-private"></a> for
additional details. The metadata associated with services are often
service-specific. For example, the metadata associated with an encrypted
messaging service can express how to initiate the encrypted link before
messaging begins.
        </p>
      <p>
Pointers to services are expressed using the <code>service</code> property.
Each service has its own <code>id</code> and <code>type</code>, as well as a
<code>serviceEndpoint</code> with a <a>URI</a> or other properties describing
the service.
      </p>

      <p>
One of the primary purposes of a <a>DID document</a> is to enable discovery of
<a>service endpoints</a>. A <a>service endpoint</a> can be any type of service
the <a>DID subject</a> wants to advertise, including
<a>decentralized identity management</a> services for further discovery,
authentication, authorization, or interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a <code>service</code> property.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>service</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
If a <a>DID document</a> includes a <code>service</code> property, the value of
the property SHOULD be an array of <a>service endpoint</a> objects. Each
<a>service endpoint</a> MUST have <code>id</code>, <code>type</code>, and
<code>serviceEndpoint</code> properties, and MAY include additional properties.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a>.
The array of <a>service endpoints</a> MUST NOT contain multiple entries
with the same <code>id</code>. In this case, a <a>DID document</a> processor
MUST produce an error.
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> property MUST be a JSON-LD object
or a valid <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized according to the
rules in section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to any normalization rules in its
applicable <a>URI</a> scheme specification.
      </p>

      <p>
It is expected that the <a>service endpoint</a> protocol is published in an open
standard specification.

    <h1>Core Representations</h1>

    <p>
All concrete representations of a <a>DID document</a> MUST be serialized using a
deterministic mapping that is able to be unambiguously parsed into the data
model defined in this specification. All serialization methods MUST define rules
for the bidirectional translation of a <a>DID document</a> both into and out of
the representation in question. As a consequence, translation between any two
representations MUST be done by parsing the source format into a <a>DID
document</a> model (described in Sections <a href="#data-model"></a> and <a
href="#core-properties"></a>) and then serializing the <a>DID document</a> model
into the target representation. An implementation MUST NOT convert between
representations without first parsing to a <a>DID document</a> model.
    </p>

    <p>
Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR here,
applications and services MAY use any other data representation syntax that is
capable of expressing the data model, such as XML or YAML.
    </p>

    <p>
Producers MUST indicate which representation of a document has been used via a
media type in the document's metadata. Consumers MUST determine which
representation a document is in via the <code>content-type</code> DID resolver
metadata field. (See <a href="#did-resolution"></a>). Consumers MUST NOT
determine the representation of a document through its content alone.
    </p>

    <p class="issue" data-number="203">
This requirement depends on the return of DID document metadata that still needs
to be defined by this specification. Once defined, that should be linked from
here.
    </p>

    <p>
The production and consumption rules in this section apply to all
implementations seeking to be fully compatible with independent implementations
of the specification. Deployments of this specification MAY use a custom
agreed-upon representation, including localized rules for handling properties
not listed in the registry. See section <a href="#extensibility"></a>

JSON-LD
        </h2>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
When producing and consuming DID documents that are in JSON-LD (as indicated by
a <code>content-type</code> of <code>application/did+ld+json</code> in the
resolver metadata), the following rules MUST be followed.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
Even though JSON-LD allows any IRI as node identifiers, <a>DID documents</a>
are explicitly restricted to only describe DIDs. This means that the value of
<code>id</code> MUST be a valid <a>DID</a> and not any other kind of IRI.
            </li>
            <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.

Production

            <p>
The <a>DID document</a> is serialized following the rules in the JSON processor,
with one addition: <a>DID documents</a> MUST include the <code>@context</code>
property.
            </p>

            <dl>
                <dt>@context</dt>
                <dd>
The value of the <code>@context</code> property MUST be one or more <a>URIs</a>,
where the value of the first <a>URI</a> is
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>. All members of the
<code>@context</code> property MUST exist be in the DID properties extension
registry.
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <p class="issue" data-number="202">
This specification defines globally interoperable documents, and the requirement
that the context value be in the verifiable data registry means that different JSON-LD
processors can consume the document without having to dereference anything in
the context field. However, a pair of producers and consumers can have local
extension agreements. This needs to be clarified in a section on extensibility
and linked here when available.

      <h2>CBOR</h2>
   <p>
Like Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]], Concise Binary Object
Representation (CBOR) [[RFC7049]] defines a set of formatting rules for the
portable representation of structured data. CBOR is a more concise,
machine-readable, language-independent data interchange format that is
self-describing and has built-in semantics for interoperability.  With specific
constraints, CBOR can support all JSON data types (including JSON-LD) for
translation between the DID document model (described in <a
href="#data-model">Data Model</a> and <a>DID Documents</a>) and other core
representations.
  </p>

  <p>
Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) [[RFC8610]] is a notation used to
express Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), and by extension JSON Data
Structures. The following notation expresses the DID Document model in CBOR
representation with specific constraints for deterministic mappings between
other core representations.

    <h4>Production</h4>
    <p>
When producing DID Documents that are represented as CBOR, in addition to the
suggestions in section 3.9 of the CBOR [[RFC7049]] specification for
deterministic mappings, the following constraints of the DID Document model
MUST be followed:
    </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
Map keys MUST be strings.
    </li>
    <li>
Integer encoding MUST be as short as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
The expression of lengths in CBOR major types 2 through 5 MUST be as short as
possible.
    </li>
    <li>
All floating point values MUST be encoded as 64-bits, even for integral values.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Consumption</h4>
  <p>
When consuming DID Documents that are represented as CBOR, in addition to the
suggestions in section 3.9 of the CBOR [[RFC7049]] specification for
deterministic mappings the following constraints of the DID Document model MUST
be followed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
The keys in every map must be sorted lowest value to highest. Sorting is
performed on the bytes of the representation of the keys.
    </li>
    <li>
Indefinite-length items must be made into definite-length items.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>CBOR Extensibility</h4>
  <p>
In CBOR, one point of extensibility is with the use of CBOR tags. [[RFC7049]]
defines a basic set of data types, as well as a tagging mechanism that enables
extending the set of data types supported via the <a
href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR Tag
Registry</a>. This allows for tags to enhance the semantic description of the
data that follows.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>DagCBOR</h2>
    <p>
DagCBOR is a further restricted subset of CBOR for representing the DID Document
as a Directed Acyclic Graph model using canonical CBOR encoding as noted above
with additional constraits.  DagCBOR requires that there exist a single way of
encoding any given object, and that encoded forms contain no superfluous data
that may be ignored or lost in a round-trip decode/encode. When producing and
consuming DID Documents representing in DagCBOR the following rules MUST be
followed
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use no CBOR tags other than the CID tag (42)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Methods</h1>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Method Schemes</h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one method-specific
<a>DID scheme</a>, identified by exactly one method name. For more information,
see the <code>method-name</code> rule in Section
<a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Because the method name is part of the <a>DID</a>, short method names are
preferred; the method name SHOULD be five characters or less. The method name
might reflect the name of the <a>verifiable data registry</a> to which the
<a>DID method</a> specification applies. For more information, see Section
<a href="#method-schemes"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification for the method-specific <a>DID scheme</a>
MUST specify how to generate the <code>method-specific-id</code> component of a
<a>DID</a>. The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be able to be
generated without the use of a centralized registry service. The
<code>method-specific-id</code> value SHOULD be globally unique by itself. The
<a>DID</a>, as defined by the <code>did</code> rule in Section
<a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>, MUST be globally unique.
      </p>

      <p>
If needed, a method-specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY define multiple
<code>method-specific-id</code> formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a
method-specific <a>DID scheme</a> define as few <code>method-specific-id</code>
formats as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
The <code>method-specific-id</code> format MAY include colons, which might be
used by <a>DID methods</a> for various purposes, such as establishing
hierarchically partitioned namespaces, or identifying specific instances or
parts of the <a>verifiable data registry</a>. The use of colons MUST comply
syntactically with the <code>method-specific-id</code> ABNF rule and their use
is entirely method-specific. Implementers are advised to avoid
assuming any meanings or behaviors associated with a colon that are
generically applicable to all <a>DID methods</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The authors of a new <a>DID method</a> specification SHOULD use a method name
that is unique among all <a>DID method</a> names known to them at the time of
publication.
      </p>
      <p>
Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving <a>DID
method</a> names, there is no way to know for certain if a specific <a>DID
method</a> name is unique. To help with this challenge, a non-authoritative
list of known <a>DID method</a> names and their associated specifications is
maintained in the DID Methods Registry, which is part of [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>
      <p>
The DID Methods Registry is a tool for implementors to use when coming to
consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for software
developers implementing <a>DID resolvers</a> for different <a>DID methods</a>.
For more information about <a>DID resolvers</a> see Section
<a href="#resolution"></a>. The DID Method Registry is not a definitive
or official list of <a>DID methods</a>. Nonetheless, adding <a>DID method</a>
names to the DID Method Registry is encouraged so that other implementors
and members of the community have a place to see an overview of existing
<a>DID methods</a>. The lightweight criteria for inclusion are documented in
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
      </p>

      <h2>Method Operations</h2>

      <p>
To enable the full functionality of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> on a
particular <a>verifiable data registry</a>, a <a>DID method</a> specification
MUST specify how a client might be used to perform the create, read, update,
and deactivate operations. Each operation ought to be specified to the level
of detail necessary to build and test interoperable client implementations. In
the event that an operation is not supported, such as update or deactivate,
then it is RECOMMENDED that the <a>DID Method</a> specification state that it
is not supported. These operations can be used to perform all the operations
required of a cryptographic key management system (CKMS), e.g.: key registration,
key replacement, key rotation, key recovery, and key expiration.
      </p>

      <p>
Determining the authority of a party to carry out the operations is
method-specific. For example, a <a>DID method</a> MAY:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
use the <a>verification methods</a> listed under <a>authentication</a> to
decide whether an update/deactivate operation is allowed; or
        </li>
        <li>
use other constructs in the <a>DID Document</a> to decide this, for example,
a verification method specified under capabilityInvocation could be used to
verify the invocation of a capability to update the DID Document.; or
        </li>
        <li>
not use the <a>DID Document</a> at all to decide this, but have rules that are
"built into" the method.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a client creates a

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a client can update a

operations necessary to establish proof of control, <em>or</em> state that
updates are not possible.
        </p>

        <p>
An update to a <a>DID</a> is any change, after creation, in the data used to
produce a <a>DID document</a>. <a>DID Method</a> implementers are responsible
for defining what constitutes an update, and what properties of the <a>DID
document</a> are supported by a given <a>DID method</a>. For example, an update
operation which replaces key material without changing it could be a valid
update that does not result in changes to the <a>DID document</a>.

Security Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Security
Considerations sections. This section MUST consider all the requirements
mentioned in section 5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the <a>DID</a> operations
defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.
      </p>
      <p>
If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the
<a>DID method</a> specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the
data are protected and what the protections are, and SHOULD give an indication
to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible.
For example, integrity only, confidentiality, endpoint authentication, and so
on.
      <p>
Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.
      </p>
      <p>
If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host
authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly
specified.
      </p>
      <p>
This section MUST discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such as
the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or
cipher) after threat mitigation was deployed.
      </p>
      <p>
This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all
operations required by Section <a href="#method-operations"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
Where <a>DID methods</a> make use of peer-to-peer computing resources, such as
with all known <a>DLTs</a>, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be
discussed in relation to denial of service.
      </p>
      <p>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where <a>DID
methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as <em>light node</em> or <em>
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a></em>
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID method</a> MUST be
discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID methods</a> MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which <a>DIDs</a> are
proven to be uniquely assigned. A <a>DID</a> fits the functional definition of a
URN, as defined in [[RFC8141]]. That is, a <a>DID</a> is a persistent identifier
that is assigned once to a resource and never reassigned to a different
resource. This is particularly important in a security context because a
<a>DID</a> might be used to identify a specific party subject to a specific set
of authorization rights.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service endpoint</a>
types (see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>) SHOULD consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.

Resolution

This section defines the inputs and outputs of <a>DID resolution</a> and <a>DID
URL dereferencing</a>. These functions are defined in an abstract way. Their
exact implementation is out of scope for this specification, but some
considerations for implementors are discussed in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]].
    </p>

    <p>
All conformant <a>DID resolvers</a> MUST implement the <a>DID resolution</a>
function for at least one <a>DID method</a> and MUST be able to return a <a>DID
document</a> in  at least one conformant representation.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>
DID Resolution
        </h2>
        <p>
The <a>DID resolution</a> function resolves a <a>DID</a> into a <a>DID
document</a> by using the "Read" operation of the applicable <a>DID method</a>.
(See <a href="#read-verify"></a>.) The details of how this process is
accomplished are outside the scope of this specification, but all conformant
implementations MUST implement a function which has the following abstract form:
        </p>

        <p><code>
resolve ( did, did-resolution-input-metadata ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt; ( did-resolution-metadata, did-document-stream, did-document-metadata )
        </code></p>

        <p>
The input variables of this function MUST be as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
did
            </dt>
            <dd>
A conformant <a>DID</a> as a single string. This is the <a>DID</a> to resolve.
This input is REQUIRED.
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-resolution-input-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
A <a href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of input
options to the <code>resolve</code> function in addition to the <code>did</code>
itself. This input is REQUIRED, but the structure MAY be empty.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
The output variables of this function MUST be as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>
did-resolution-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
A <a href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a> consisting of values
relating to the results of the <a>DID resolution</a> process. This structure is
REQUIRED and MUST NOT be empty. This metadata typically changes between
invocations of the <code>resolve</code> function as it represents data about the
resolution process itself.
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-document-stream
            </dt>
            <dd>
If the resolution is successful, this MUST be a byte stream of the resolved
<a>DID document</a> in one of the conformant <a href="#representations">representations</a>. The byte
stream MAY then be parsed by the caller of the <code>resolve</code> function
into a <a>DID document</a> abstract data model, which can in turn be validated
and processed. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value MUST be an empty
stream.
            </dd>
            <dt>
did-document-metadata
            </dt>
            <dd>
If the resolution is successful, this MUST be a <a
href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a>. This structure contains
metadata about the <a>DID document</a> contained in the
<code>did-document-stream</code>. This metadata typically does not change
between invocations of the <code>resolve</code> function unless the <a>DID
document</a> changes, as it represents data about the <a>DID document</a>. If
the resolution is unsuccessful, this output MUST be an empty <a
href="metadata-structure">metadata structure</a>.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
<a>DID resolver</a> implementations MUST NOT alter the signature of this
function in any way. <a>DID resolver</a> implementations MAY map the
<code>resolve</code> function to a method-specific internal function to perform
the actual <a>DID resolution</a> process. <a>DID resolver</a> implementations
MAY implement  and expose additional
functions with different signatures in addition to the <code>resolve</code>
function specified here.

Security Considerations

During the Working Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that
should be important in early implementations. The editors are seeking feedback
on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. <a>DIDs</a> are designed to operate under the general
Internet threat model used by many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised
endpoints, but anticipate that messages could be read or corrupted on the
network. Protecting against an attack when a system is compromised requires
external key-signing hardware (see Section <a

bear in mind that there is no central authority to mandate which

<a>DID method</a> name, but can use the DID Method Registry to make an
informed decision when choosing which <a>DID resolver</a> implementations to

      <h2>
Binding of Identity
      </h2>

      <p>
The following sections describe binding identities to <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
Proving Control of a DID and DID Document
        </h3>

        <p>
Signatures and <a>verifiable timestamps</a> allow <a>DID documents</a> to be cryptographically
verifiable.
        </p>

        <p>
By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed <a>DID document</a> does not
prove control of a <a>DID</a>. It only proves that the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>DID document</a> was not tampered with since it was timestamped.
          </li>

          <li>
<a>DID controller(s)</a> controlled the private key used for the signature at
the time the timestamp was created.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Proving control of a <a>DID</a>, that is, the binding between the <a>DID</a> and
the <a>DID document</a> that describes it, requires a two step process:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Resolving the <a>DID</a> to a <a>DID document</a> according to its
<a>DID method</a> specification.
          </li>

          <li>
Verifying that the <code>id</code> property of the resulting <a>DID document</a>
matches the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It should be noted that this process proves control of a <a>DID</a> and
<a>DID document</a> regardless of whether the <a>DID document</a> is signed.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures on <a>DID documents</a> are optional. <a>DID method</a>
specifications SHOULD explain and specify their implementation if applicable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
Proving Control of a Public Key
        </h3>

        <p>
There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to a
<a>public key description</a> in the <a>DID document</a>: static and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
The static method is to sign the <a>DID document</a> with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the
<a>DID document</a> was registered. If the <a>DID document</a> is not signed,
control of a public key described in the <a>DID document</a> can still be proven
dynamically as follows:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Send a challenge message containing a <a>public key description</a> from the
<a>DID document</a> and a nonce to an appropriate <a>service endpoint</a>
described in the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
Verify the signature of the response message against the
<a>public key description</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
Authentication and Verifiable Claims
        </h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">
  PII</a>
(personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a <a>DID</a> to
something in the real world, such as a person or a company, for example with
credentials with the same subject as that <a>DID</a>, is out of scope for this
specification. For more information, see the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] instead.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Authentication Service Endpoints
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service endpoint</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (see Section <a
href="#service-endpoints"></a>), it is the responsibility of the <a>service
endpoint</a> provider, subject, or relying party to comply with the requirements
of the authentication protocols supported at that <a>service endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Non-Repudiation
      </h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported
under the assumption that the subject:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section
<a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>).
        </li>
        <li>
Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the
access control mechanism for the <a>DID method</a> (see Section
<a href="#authentication"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Sections
<a href="#created"></a> and <a href="#updated"></a>) and the target <a>DLT</a>
system supports timestamps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Notification of DID Document Changes
      </h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file.
      </p>
      <p>
In the case of a <a>DID</a>, there is no intermediary registrar or account
provider to generate such notifications. However, if the <a>verifiable data registry</a>
on which the <a>DID</a> is registered directly supports change notifications,
a subscription service can be offered to <a>DID controllers</a>. Notifications
could be sent directly to the relevant <a>service endpoints</a> listed in an
existing <a>DID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
If a <a>DID controller</a> chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
(other than the <a>verifiable data registry</a> itself), this introduces another
vector of attack.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key and Signature Expiration
      </h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore
<a>DID resolvers</a> and other client applications need to validate that keys
were not expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases might have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure a key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key, and implementations
of a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key Revocation and Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#method-operations"></a> specifies the <a>DID</a> operations to
be supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification, including deactivation of a
<a>DID document</a> by replacing it with an updated <a>DID document</a>. It is
also up to the <a>DID method</a> to define how revocation of cryptographic keys
might occur. Additionally, <a>DID method</a> specifications are also expected
to enable support for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key recovery. Some
of the facilities to do so are suggested in Section
<a href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>. Not all <a>DID method</a>
specifications will recognize control from <a>DIDs</a> registered using other
<a>DID methods</a> and they might restrict third-party control to <a>DIDs</a>
that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a <a>DID method</a>
specification can also include a time lock feature to protect against key
compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further
specification of this type of control is a matter for future work.
</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
      </h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability.
The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
demonstrates the axiom about identifiers described in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>:
"human-meaningful, decentralized, secure &mdash; pick any two".
      </p>

      <p>
There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to
discover a <a>DID</a> when starting from a human-friendly identifier. For
example, a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for
a <a>DID controller</a>, such as a mobile telephone number, email address,
Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly
identifiers to <a>DIDs</a> (and doing so in a way that can be verified and
trusted) is outside the scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate
specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended
that such specifications carefully consider the:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.
        </li>
        <li>
Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
A draft specification for discovering a <a>DID</a> from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[?DNS-DID]].

    <section>
        <h2>
Immutability
        </h2>

        <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the <a>DID</a>
ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this specification is
focused on a data model instead of a protocol, it offers no opinion about many
aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual <a>DID methods</a>
might want to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics
they do not need. The more <em>locked down</em> a <a>DID method</a> is, while
providing the same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious
actors.
        </p>
        <p>
As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with respect
to updating. A single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change anything and
everything except the root <code>id</code> property of the document. And any
individual JSON object in the data model can change all of its properties except
its <code>id</code>. But is it actually desirable for a <a>service endpoint</a>
to change its <code>type</code> after it is defined? Or for a key to change its
value? Or would it be better to require a new <code>id</code> when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a web site
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its identifier (the host name),
but gets subtle, dangerous changes underneath. If certain properties of the site
were required by the specification to be immutable (for example, the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>
associated with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more
expensive to carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
The notion that immutability provides some cybersecurity benefits is
particularly relevant because of caching. For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a
global source of truth, a direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a
<a>DID document</a> is always possible. However, it seems likely that layers of
cache might eventually sit between a client and that source of truth. If they
do, believing the attributes of an object in the <a>DID document</a> to have a
given state, when they are actually subtly different, might invite exploits.
This is particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>, and
others are of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

      <h2>
Encrypted Data in DID Documents
      </h2>
      <p>
DID documents are typically publicly available. Encryption algorithms have been
known to fail due to advances in cryptography and computing power. Implementers
are advised to assume that any encrypted data placed in a <a>DID document</a>
might eventually be made available in clear text to the same audience to which
the encrypted data is available.
      </p>
      <p>
Encrypting all or parts of DID documents is <em>not</em> an appropriate means to
protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in DID
documents is not an appropriate means to include personally identifiable
information.
      </p>
      <p>
Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a DID document,
implementers are advised to not encrypt with the public keys of entities that do
not wish to be correlated with the <a>DID</a>.

    <h1>
Privacy Considerations
    </h1>

    <p>
It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
to all aspects of the <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, because
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are, by design, administered directly by
the <a>DID controller(s)</a>. There is no registrar, hosting company, or other
intermediate service provider to recommend or apply additional privacy
safeguards. The authors of this specification have applied all seven Privacy by
Design principles throughout its development. For example, privacy in this
specification is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default.
Furthermore, the <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture by itself embodies
principle #7, "Respect for user privacy &mdash; keep it user-centric."
    </p>

    <p>
This section lists additional privacy considerations that implementers,
delegates, and <a>DID subjects</a> should keep in mind.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public <a>verifiable data
registry</a> where all <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> are publicly
available, it is <em>critical</em> that <a>DID documents</a> contain no
personal data. All personal data should be kept behind <a>service
endpoints</a> under the control of the <a>DID subject</a>. Additional due
diligence should be taken around the use of URLs in service endpoints as well
to prevent leakage of unintentional personal data or correlation within a URL
of a service endpoint. For example, a URL that contains a username is likely
dangerous to include in a <a>DID Document</a> because the username is likely
to be human-meaningful in a way that can unintentionally reveal information
that the <a>DID subject</a> did not consent to sharing. With this privacy
architecture, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis
using communications channels identified and secured by <a>public key
descriptions</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also enables <a>DID
subjects</a> and relying parties to implement the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right to be
forgotten</a>, because no personal data is written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs
      </h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unique identifier, <a>DIDs</a> might be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise unique <a>DIDs</a>, that is, sharing a different private <a>DID</a> for
every relationship. In effect, each <a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A
pseudonymous <a>DID</a> need only be shared with more than one party when
the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties.
If pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need for a public
<a>DID</a> (a <a>DID</a> published openly or shared with a large number of
parties) is when the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly desires public
identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
DID Document Correlation Risks
      </h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are easily defeated
if the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be correlated. For
example, using same <a>public key descriptions</a> or bespoke
<a>service endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide as much
correlation information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore the
<a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a> also needs to use pairwise
unique public keys.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique <a>service endpoints</a> in
the <a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a>. However, unique endpoints
allow all traffic between two <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into unique
buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among
thousands or millions of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different subjects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Herd Privacy
      </h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy
is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party
is by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. <a>DIDs</a>
and <a>DID methods</a> need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for
those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces
that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">
  digital fingerprints</a>,
share common settings across client implementations, keep negotiated options to
a minimum on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.
