<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier to
provide verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are
designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over
it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity
provider, or certificate authority. <a>DIDs</a> are URLs that relate a
<a>DID subject</a> to a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions with
that subject. <a>DID documents</a> are simple documents describing how to use
that specific <a>DID</a>. Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic
material, verification methods, or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a
set of mechanisms enabling a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions with the
<a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.

    <h1>
Introduction
    </h1>

    <p>
Conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">identity management</a>
systems are based on centralized authorities such as corporate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service">directory services</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities</a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry">domain name registries</a>.
From the standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these
centralized authorities serves as its own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor">root of trust</a>. To make
identity management work across these systems requires implementing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">federated identity management</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
The emergence of <a>distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) and
<a>blockchain technology</a> provides the opportunity for fully
<a>decentralized identity management</a>. In a decentralized identity system,
entities (that is, discrete identifiable units such as, but not limited to,
people, organizations, and things) are free to use any shared root of trust.
Globally distributed ledgers, decentralized P2P networks, or other systems
with similar capabilities, provide the means for managing a root of
trust without introducing a centralized authority or a single point of
failure. In combination, <a>DLTs</a> and
<a>decentralized identity management</a> systems enable any entity to create and
manage their own identifiers on any number of distributed, independent roots of
trust.
    </p>

    <p>
Entities are identified by <a>decentralized identifiers</a> (<a>DIDs</a>), and
can authenticate using proofs (for example, digital signatures,
privacy-preserving biometric protocols, and so on). <a>DIDs</a> point to
<a>DID documents</a>. A <a>DID document</a> contains a set of
<a>service endpoints</a> for interacting with the entity that the <a>DID</a>
identifies (that is, the <a>DID subject</a>). Following the guidelines of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by
Design</a>, any entity can have as many <a>DIDs</a> (and corresponding
<a>DID documents</a> and <a>service endpoints</a>) as necessary to respect the
entity’s desired separation of identities, personas, and contexts (in the
everyday sense of these words).
    </p>

    <p>
<a>DID methods</a> are the mechanism by which a <a>DID</a> and its associated
<a>DID document</a> are created, read, updated, and deactivated on a specific
<a>distributed ledger</a> or network. <a>DID methods</a> are defined using
separate <a>DID method</a> specifications.
    </p>

    <p>
This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for
identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key
management, which is the standard in hierarchical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI (public key infrastructure</a>).
In cases where the <a>DID registry</a> is a <a>distributed ledger</a>, each
entity can serve as its own root authority. This architecture is referred to as
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">DPKI (decentralized PKI)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
<a>DID methods</a> can also be developed for identifiers registered in federated
or centralized identity management systems. Indeed, all types of identifier
systems can add support for <a>DIDs</a>. This creates an interoperability bridge
between the worlds of centralized, federated, and
<a>decentralized identifiers</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
The first purpose of this specification is to define the generic
<a>DID scheme</a> and a generic set of operations on <a>DID documents</a> that
can be implemented for any <a>DID registry</a>. The second purpose of this
specification is to define the conformance requirements for a <a>DID method</a>
specification. The <a>DID method</a> specification is a separate document that
defines a specific <a>DID scheme</a> and specific set of <a>DID document</a>
operations for a specific <a>DID registry</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a
<a>DID method</a> specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF
generic <a>URI</a> specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific <a>URI</a> scheme
([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]] (such as the http: and https: schemes specified in
[[RFC7230]]). It is also similar to the relationship between the IETF generic
URN specification ([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition, (such
as the <a>UUID</a> URN namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that
a <a>DID method</a> specification, as well as defining a specific
<a>DID scheme</a>, also specifies the methods for resolving and deactivating
<a>DIDs</a> on, and writing <a>DID documents</a> to, the appropriate
<a>DID registry</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
The hierarchical design of a generic <a>DID</a> specification with specific
<a>DID method</a> specifications introduces some of the same concepts as the
<a>URI</a> specification:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>DIDs</a> from different <a>DID methods</a> might not be interoperable, just
as <a>URIs</a> from different URI schemes might not be interoperable.
        </li>
        <li>
Entities might need multiple <a>DIDs</a> to support different relationships
because the other party might only support certain <a>DID methods</a>, in the
same way that some browsers might only support certain URI schemes.
        </li>
        <li>
Entities might need multiple <a>DIDs</a> to support the different cryptographic
schemes of different <a>DID methods</a> because not all parties will support the
same cryptographic schemes, in the same way that not all browsers support the
same URI schemes.
        </li>
        <li>
Managing multiple <a>DIDs</a>, and tracking which <a>DID</a> belongs to which
relationship, under which cryptographic scheme, introduces similar logistical
challenges as managing multiple web addresses and tracking which address belongs
to which website, or tracking which email address belongs to which relationship.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
For a list of <a>DID methods</a> and their corresponding specifications,
see the DID Method Registry [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

    <h2>
A Simple Example
    </h2>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is a simple text string consisting of three parts, the:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
URL scheme identifier (<code>did</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
Identifier for the <a>DID method</a>
        </li>
        <li>
DID method-specific identifier.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple example of a decentralized identifier (DID)">
did:example:123456789abcdefghi
    </pre>

    <p>
The example <a>DID</a> above resolves to a <a>DID document</a>. A
<a>DID document</a> contains information associated with the <a>DID</a>, such as
ways to cryptographically authenticate the entity in control of the <a>DID</a>,
as well as services that can be used to interact with the entity.

    <h3>
Interoperability
    </h3>

    <p>
Interoperability of implementations for <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a>
will be tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> that conform to the specification.
Interoperability for <a>DID methods</a> will be determined by evaluating each
<a>DID method</a> specification to determine, at a minimum, that the:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> name is unique and not used by an existing, incompatible
<a>DID method</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Required operations are supported.
        </li>
        <li>
Operations requiring descriptions are described.
        </li>
        <li>
Specification is specific, detailed, and complete enough for independent
implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
Specification contains sections describing security and privacy considerations.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
Interoperability for producers and consumers of <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a> is provided by ensuring the <a>DIDs</a> and
<a>DID documents</a> conform. Interoperability for <a>DID method</a>
specifications is provided by the details in each <a>DID method</a>
specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web browser is not
required to implement all known URI schemes, conformant software that works
with <a>DIDs</a> is not required to implement all known <a>DID methods</a>.
However, all implementations of a given <a>DID method</a> must be interoperable
for that method.

Data Model
    </h1>

    <p>
This section outlines the <a>decentralized identifier</a> data model concepts,
specifically, how keys, services, and the <a>DID subject</a> are related to the
<a>DID document</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>
Identifier
    </h2>

    <p>
Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of people,
organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general. Identifiers are
typically URLs, or more generally, <a>URIs</a>. Non-<a>URI</a>-based identifiers
are not advised because, while the data model supports them, they are not easy
to use with other Internet-based identifiers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>
DID Document
    </h2>

   <p>
A <a>DID document</a> is the resource that is associated with a
<a>decentralized identifier</a> (DID). <a>DID documents</a> typically express
verification methods (such as public keys) and services that can be used to
interact with a <a>DID controller</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
A <a>DID document</a> is serialized according to a particular syntax, as
outlined in Section <a href="#did-document-syntax"></a>). The <a>DID</a> itself
is contained in the <code>id</code> property.
    </p>

    <p>
The properties that can be present in a <a>DID document</a> are outlined in
Section <a href="#did-documents"></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
The properties present in a <a>DID document</a> can be updated according to
the applicable operations outlined in Section <a href="#did-methods"></a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>
Cryptographic Keys and Other Verification Methods
    </h2>

    <p>
A <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic keys and other verification
methods, which can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the
<a>DID subject</a> or associated parties. The information expressed often
includes globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material, which can be
used to verify digital signatures. Other information can be expressed, such as
status information for the key (for example, whether it is suspended or
revoked), or other attributes that enable one to determine whether it is a
hardware-backed cryptographic key.
    </p>

    <p>
Regarding cryptographic key material, public keys can be included in a
<a>DID document</a> using, for example, the <code>publicKey</code> or
<code>authentication</code> properties, depending on what they are to be used
for. Each public key has an identifier (<code>id</code>) of its own, a
<code>type</code>, and a <code>controller</code>, as well as other properties
that depend on the type of key it is. For more information, see Section
<a href="#public-keys"></a>.

      <p>
This specification strives to limit the number of formats for expressing public
key material in a DID Document to the fewest possible, to increase the
likelihood of interoperability. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment. The specific
types of key formats that are supported in this specification are listed in <a
href="#public-keys"></a>.

      <h2>
Services
    </h2>

    <p>
<a>Service endpoints</a> are used in <a>DID documents</a> to express ways of
communicating with the <a>DID subject</a> or associated entities. Services
listed in the <a>DID document</a> can contain information about privacy
preserving messaging services, or more public information, such as social media
accounts, personal websites, and email addresses. The metadata associated with
services are often service-specific. For example, the metadata associated with
an encrypted messaging service can express how to initiate the encrypted link
before messaging begins.
    </p>

    <p>
Pointers to services are expressed using the <code>service</code> property.
Each service has its own <code>id</code> and <code>type</code>, as well as a
<code>serviceEndpoint</code> with a <a>URI</a> or other properties describing
the service.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
    </h1>

    <p>
The concept of a globally unique <a>decentralized identifier</a> is not new.
<a>Universally Unique Identifiers</a> (UUIDs) were first developed in the 1980s
and later became a standard feature of the Open Software Foundation’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment">Distributed Computing Environment</a>.
<a>UUIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without a centralized registry service by
using an algorithm that generates 128-bit values with sufficient entropy that
the chance of collision are infinitesimally small. <a>UUIDs</a> are formally
specified in [[RFC4122]] as a specific type of Unified Resource Name (URN).
    </p>

    <p>
A <a>DID</a> is similar to a <a>UUID</a> except that:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
Like a URL, it can be resolved or dereferenced to a standard resource describing
the subject. That is, a <a>DID document</a>. For more information, see Section
<a href="#did-documents"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Unlike most resources returned when dereferencing URLs, a <a>DID document</a>
usually contains cryptographic material enabling authentication of the
<a>DID subject</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>
Generic DID Syntax
      </h2>

      <p>
The generic <a>DID scheme</a> is a URI scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]]. The
<a>DID scheme</a> specializes only the scheme and authority components of a
<a>DID URL</a>. The <code>path-abempty</code>, <code>query</code>, and
<code>fragment</code> components are identical to the ABNF rules defined in
[[!RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <p class="note">
The term <a>DID</a> refers only to the <a>URI</a> conforming to the
<code>did</code> rule in the ABNF below. A <a>DID</a> always identifies the
<a>DID subject</a>. The term <a>DID URL</a>, defined by the <code>did-url</code>
rule, refers to a URL that begins with a <a>DID</a> followed by one or more
additional components. A <a>DID URL</a> always identifies the resource to
be located.
      </p>

      <p>
The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]], which
defines <code>ALPHA</code> and <code>DIGIT</code>. All other rule names not
defined in this ABNF are defined in [[RFC3986]].
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-number="34">
The grammar currently allows an empty <code>method-specific-id</code>,

      <h2>
Generic DID Parameter Names
      </h2>

      <p>
The <a>DID URL</a> syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters
based on the matrix parameter syntax ([[MATRIX-URIS]]). The ABNF above does not
specify any parameter names (the <code>param-name</code> rule).
      </p>
      <p>
Some generic DID parameter names (for example, for service selection) are
completely independent of any specific <a>DID method</a> and MUST always
function the same way for all <a>DIDs</a>. Other DID parameter names (for
example, for versioning) MAY be supported by certain <a>DID methods</a>, but
MUST operate uniformly across those <a>DID methods</a> that do support them.
      </p>
      <p>
Parameter names that are completely method-specific are described in Section
<a href="#method-specific-did-parameter-names"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names.

The exact processing rules for these parameters are specified in
[[DID-RESOLUTION]].
      </p>

      <p class="note">
There might be additional parameters or options that are not part of the DID
URL, but instead passed to a <a>DID resolver</a> <em>out-of-band</em>, that is,
using a resolution protocol or some other mechanism. Such options could for
example, control caching or the desired format of a resolution result. This is
similar to HTTP, where caching or result format are expressed as HTTP headers
instead of as part of an HTTP URL. The important distinction is that DID
parameters that are part of the <a>DID URL</a> specify what resource is being
identified, whereas <a>DID resolver</a> options that are not part of the
<a>DID URL</a> control how that resource is dereferenced.

      <h2>
Method-Specific DID Parameter Names
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MAY specify additional method-specific
parameter names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method
name, as defined by the <code>method-name</code> rule.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, if the method <code>did:foo:</code> defines the parameter bar, the
parameter name must be <code>foo:bar</code>. An example <a>DID URL</a> using
this method and this method-specific parameter would be as shown below.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=high
      </pre>

      <p class="issue" data-number="35">
Consider using kebab-case style instead of colon separator,
e.g., <code>foo-bar</code> instead of <code>foo:bar</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
A method-specific parameter name defined by one <a>DID method</a> MAY be used by
other <a>DID methods</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=low
      </pre>

      <p>
Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter names in
any order.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight">
did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;service=agent;foo:bar=high
      </pre>

      <p>
Both <a>DID method</a> namespaces and method-specific parameter namespaces MAY
include colons, so they might be partitioned hierarchically, as defined by a
<a>DID method</a> specification. The following example <a>DID URL</a>
illustrates both.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight">

Path

      <p>
A generic <a>DID path</a> is identical to a URI path and MUST conform to the

used to address resources available through a <a>service endpoint</a>. For more
information, see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>.

to address resources available through a <a>service endpoint</a>. For more
information, see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>.

      <h2>
Fragment
      </h2>

      <p>
A generic <a>DID fragment</a> is identical to a URI fragment and MUST conform to
the <code>fragment</code> ABNF rule in [[RFC3986]]. Implementers are strongly
discouraged from using a <a>DID fragment</a> for anything other than a
method-independent reference into the <a>DID document</a> to identify a
component of a <a>DID document</a> (for example, a unique
<a>public key description</a> or <a>service endpoint</a>). To resolve this
reference, the complete <a>DID URL</a> including the <a>DID fragment</a> MUST be
used as input to the <a>DID URL</a> dereferencing algorithm for the
target component in the <a>DID document</a> object. For more information, see
[[DID-RESOLUTION]].
      </p>

      <p>
A specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY specify ABNF rules for <a>DID fragments</a>
that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations need not rely on graph-based processing of <a>DID documents</a>
to locate metadata contained in the <a>DID document</a> when the <a>DID</a>
includes a <a>DID fragment</a>. Tree-based processing can be used instead.
      </p>

Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, make <a>DID</a> normalization as simple and
universal as possible:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
The <a>DID scheme</a> name MUST be lowercase.
          </li>

          <li>
The <a>DID method</a> name MUST be lowercase.
          </li>

          <li>
Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the
<code>method-specific-id</code> rule in Section
<a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a> MUST be defined by the governing
<a>DID method</a> specification.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Persistence
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID</a> is expected to be persistent and immutable. That is, a <a>DID</a>
is bound exclusively and permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a
<a>DID</a> is deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.
      </p>

      <p>
Ideally, a <a>DID</a> would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier
(like a <a>UUID</a>) that could be bound to multiple underlying
<a>DID registries</a> over time, thus maintaining its persistence independent of
any particular system. However, registering the same identifier on multiple
<a>DID registries</a> introduces extremely hard entityship and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA">start-of-authority</a>
(SOA) problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for
developers.
      </p>

      <p>
To avoid these issues, it is RECOMMENDED that <a>DID method</a> specifications
only produce <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID methods</a> bound to strong, stable
<a>DID registries</a> capable of making the highest level of commitment to
persistence of the <a>DID</a> and <a>DID method</a> over time.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification
might support a <a>DID document</a> <code>equivID</code> property to establish
verifiable equivalence relations between <a>DIDs</a> representing the same
subject on multiple <a>DID registries</a>. Such equivalence relations can
produce the practical equivalent of a single persistent abstract <a>DID</a>. For

        <p>
When two software systems need to exchange data, they need to use terminology

mutually agreed terminology.

The value of the <code>@context</code> property MUST be one or more
<a>URIs</a>, where the value of the first <a>URI</a> is
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>. If more than one
<a>URI</a> is provided, the <a>URIs</a> MUST be interpreted as an ordered set.

      <h2>Delegates</h2>

The way that Delegates are handled is changing. The feature is still supported,
but via the `authorizationCapability` field rather than the more specialized
`guardian` field.

A delegate is an entity, such as a parent or aid organization, that creates and
maintains a <a>DID document</a> for a dependent who is not in a position to hold
or control authentication credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys).

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
A <a>DID document</a> that includes an
<code>authentication</code> field
(Section <a href="#authentication"></a>) MAY list one or
more delegates via the <code>authorizationCapability</code> field.
          </li>
          <li>
A <a>DID document</a> that does not include an
<code>authentication</code> MUST have a delegate.
          </li>
          <li>
The <code>authorizationCapability</code> field must contain a capability for the
delegate that includes <code>UpdateDidDocument</code> as the capability,
the <a>DID</a> of the delegate as the <code>entity</code>, and MAY include a
more specific set of <code>authentication</code>s that the
delegate MAY use to authenticate when updating the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The delegate <a>DID</a> MUST resolve to a <a>DID document</a> that has a

i.e., the delegate relationships must not be nested.

Public Keys

Public keys are used for digital signatures, encryption and other
cryptographic operations, which in turn are the basis for purposes
such as authentication (see Section <a href="#authentication"></a>)
or establishing secure communication with <a>service endpoints</a>
(see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>). In addition, public
keys may play a role in authorization mechanisms of <a>DID</a> CRUD
operations (see Section <a href="#did-operations"></a>), which can be
defined by <a>DID method</a> specifications.
      </p>

      <dl>
          <dt><dfn>publicKey</dfn></dt>

The value of the <code>publicKey</code> property MUST be an array of

properties, and SHOULD have an <code>id</code> property. The object
MAY include additional properties.
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property (if present) MUST be a URI. The array

The value of the <code>type</code> property MUST be exactly one public key value
(see available key types in Appendix <a href="#registries"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>controller</code> property, which identifies the
controller of the corresponding private key, MUST be a valid DID.
      </p>

      <p>
All public key properties MUST be from the Linked Data Cryptographic Suite Registry.
A registry of key types and formats is available in Appendix <a href="#registries"></a>
      </p>

      <p>
If a public key does not exist in the <a>DID document</a>, it MUST be
assumed the key has been revoked or is invalid. The <a>DID document</a> MAY
contain revoked keys. A <a>DID document</a> that contains a revoked key MUST
also contain or refer to the revocation information for the key (e.g.,
a revocation list). Each <a>DID method</a> specification is expected to
detail how revocation is performed and tracked.
      </p>

      <p>
All public key formats MUST be expressed in either JSON Web Key (JWK)
format using the <code>publicKeyJwk</code> property or one of the
formats listed in the table below. Public key expression MUST NOT use any other key format.
      </p>

A key MAY be <em>embedded</em> or <em>referenced</em> in a <a>DID

      <p>
The algorithm to use when processing a <code>publicKey</code>
property in a <a>DID document</a> is:
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Let <em>value</em> be the data associated with the
        <code>publicKey</code> property and initialize <em>result</em> to
        <code>null</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is an object, the key material is embedded. Set
        <em>result</em> to <em>value</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>value</em> is a string, the key is included by reference.
Assume <em>value</em> is a URL.
          <ol>
            <li>
Dereference the URL and retrieve the <code>publicKey</code>
properties associated with the URL (e.g., process the
<code>publicKey</code> property at the top-level of the
dereferenced document).
            </li>

            <li>
Iterate through each public key object.
              <ol>
                <li>
If the <code>id</code> property of the object matches
<em>value</em>, set <em>result</em> to the object.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
If <em>result</em> does not contain at least the <code>id</code>,
<code>type</code>, and <code>controller</code> properties as well as any
mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the
<em>result</em>'s <code>type</code> property, throw an error.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">
While the <code>controller</code> field may seem redundant in some of the
examples above, keys may be expressed in a <a>DID document</a> where the
controller is described in another <a>DID document</a>. Linked Data Proof
libraries typically expect the <code>controller</code> field to always
exist and may throw an exception if it is missing. Furthermore, per
the requirement that <a>DID documents</a> be interpretable as either a graph
or a tree, a default <code>controller</code> field cannot be inferred by
using a key's position in a tree.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Caching and expiration of the keys in a <a>DID document</a> is entirely the
responsibility of <a>DID resolvers</a> and other clients. See Section
<a href="#did-resolvers"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Authentication
      </h2>

      <p>
Authentication is the mechanism by which <a>DID controllers</a> can
cryptographically prove that they are associated with a <a>DID</a>. For more
information, see Section <a href="#binding-of-identity"></a>. Note that
Authentication is separate from Authorization because <a>DID controllers</a>
might wish to enable others to update their <a>DID document</a> (for example, to
assist with key recovery, as discussed in Section
<a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a>) without enabling them to prove
control (and thus be able to impersonate the <a>DID controller(s)</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include an <code>authentication</code>
property. If so:
      </p>
      <dl>
          <dt><dfn>authentication</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>authentication</code> property SHOULD be
an array of verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded
or referenced. An example of a verification method is a public key (see
Section <a href="#public-keys"></a>).
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>
Authorization and Delegation
      </h2>

      <p>
Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations may be
performed on behalf of the <a>DID subject</a>. Delegation is the
mechanism that the subject uses to authorize others to act
on their behalf. Note that Authorization is separate from
Authentication as explained in Section <a href="#authentication"></a>.
This is particularly important for key
recovery in the case of key loss, when the subject no longer has
access to their keys, or key compromise, where the <a>DID controller</a>'s
trusted third parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See
Section <a href="#security-considerations"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Each <a>DID method</a> MUST define how authorization and delegation are
implemented, including any necessary cryptographic operations.
      </p>

      <p>
There are at least two suggested methods for implementing
Authorization and Delegation, which may be layered:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
A <a>DID registry</a> could implement a coarse
grained <code>controller</code> pattern by enabling <a>DID documents</a> to
express the <a>DID</a> of another <a>DID controller</a> that controls it, or
additionally,
        </li>

        <li>
A <a>DID registry</a> could implement a
Capabilities-based approach that enables further fine-grained control
of authorization and delegation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
Example:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="DID document with a controller property">
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",

    <section>
      <h2>
Service Endpoints
      </h2>

      <p>
One of the primary purposes of a <a>DID document</a> is to enable
discovery of <a>service endpoints</a>. A <a>service
endpoint</a> can be any type of service the <a>DID subject</a> wishes to
advertise, including <a>decentralized identity management</a> services for
further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MAY include a <code>service</code> property. If so:
      </p>

      <dl>
          <dt><dfn>service</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>service</code> property SHOULD be an array
of <a>service endpoint</a> objects. Each service endpoint MUST
have <code>type</code> and <code>serviceEndpoint</code> properties,
SHOULD have an <code>id</code> property, and MAY include additional
properties.
          </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
The value of the <code>id</code> property (if present) MUST be a URI.
The array of <a>service endpoints</a> MUST NOT contain multiple entries
with the same <code>id</code>. A <a>DID document</a> processor MUST
produce an error in that case.
      </p>

      <p>
The value of the <code>serviceEndpoint</code> property MUST be a
JSON-LD object or a valid <a>URI</a> conforming to [[RFC3986]] and
normalized according to the rules in section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to
any normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification.
      </p>

      <p>
It is expected that the <a>service endpoint</a> protocol is
published in an open standard specification.
      </p>

      <h2>
Extensibility
      </h2>

      <p>
One of the goals of the <a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model is to
enable permissionless innovation. This requires that the data model
is extensible in a number of different ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The requirement to model complex multi-entity relationships is
provided through the use of a graph-based data model.
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to enable extending the machine-readable
vocabularies used to describe information in the data model &mdash;
without relying on a centralized system &mdash; is accomplished via
the use of [[LINKED-DATA]].
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to support multiple types of cryptographic proof
formats is accomplished via the use of Linked Data Proofs
[[LD-PROOFS]], Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]], and a
variety of signature suites.
        </li>

        <li>
The requirement to provide all of the extensibility mechanisms
outlined above in a data format that is popular among software
developers and web page authors is enabled via the use of
[[!JSON-LD]].
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
This approach to data modeling is often called an "open world
assumption", meaning that anyone can say anything about any other
thing. This approach often feels in conflict with building simple
and predictable software systems. Balancing extensibility with
program correctness is always more challenging with an open world
assumption than it is with closed software systems.
      </p>

      <p>
The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.
      </p>

      <p>
Let us assume that we start with the following <a>DID document</a>:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple DID document">
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "publicKey": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
  "authentication": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
  "service": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }]
}
      </pre>
      <p>
The contents of the <code>publicKey</code>,
<code>authentication</code>, and <code>service</code> properties are
not important for the purposes of this section. What is important is
that the object above is a valid <a>DID document</a>. Let's assume
that a developer wanted to extend the <a>DID document</a> to express
an additional piece of information: the subject's public photo
stream.
      </p>

      <p>
The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context
containing the new term:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="An example JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
Now that the JSON-LD Context has been created, the developer MUST
publish it somewhere that is accessible to any <a>DID document</a>
processor. For this example, let us assume that the JSON-LD Context
above is published at the following URL:
<code>did:example:contexts:987654321</code>. At this point, extending
the first example in this section is a simple matter of including the
context above and adding the new property to the <a>DID document</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID document with a custom extension">
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [ <span class="comment">...</span> ],
  "service": [<span class="highlight">{
    "@context": "did:example:contexts:987654321",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#photos",
    "type": "PhotoStreamService",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.org/photos/379283"
  }</span>]
}
      </pre>
      <p>
The examples so far have shown that it is easy to extend the
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model in a permissionless and
decentralized way. The mechanism also ensures that <a>decentralized
identifiers</a> created in this way prevent namespace conflicts and
semantic ambiguity.
      </p>

      <p>
An extensibility model that is this dynamic does increase
implementation burden. Software written for such a system will have
to determine if accepting <a>DID document</a>s with extensions is
acceptable based on the risk profile of the application. Some
applications may choose to accept but ignore extensions, others may
choose to only accept certain extensions, while highly secure
environments may disallow extensions. These decisions are up to the
application developers and are specifically not the domain of this
specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD
Context overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in this
specification. To avoid the possibility of accidentally overriding
terms, developers SHOULD scope their extensions. For example,
the following extension scopes the new
<code>PhotoStreamService</code> term so that it may only be used
within the <code>service</code> property:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Scoping terms in a JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    <span class="highlight">"service": {
      "@id": "https://w3id.org/did#service",
      "@context": {
        "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
      }
    }</span>
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are
highly available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will
produce an error. Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD
Contexts are always available include using content-addressed URLs
for contexts, bundling context documents with implementations, or
enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

DID Document Syntax
    </h1>

      <p>
A <a>DID document</a> MUST be a single JSON object conforming to [[!RFC8259]].
Many of the concepts in this document were introduced by example using the
JSON-LD syntax, a format for mapping JSON data into the RDF semantic graph
model, as defined by [[!JSON-LD]]. This section formalizes how the data model
(described in Sections <a href="#data-model"></a> and
<a href="#did-documents"></a>) is realized in JSON-LD.
      </p>
      <p>
Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON and JSON-LD only, applications
and services can use any other data representation syntax, such as JXD (JSON XDI
Data, a serialization format for the
<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-core-v1.0-csd01.xml">XDI graph model</a>),
XML, YAML, or CBOR, that is capable of expressing the data model.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
JSON
      </h2>

        <p>
The data model, as described in Section <a href="#data-model"></a>, can be
encoded in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]] by mapping property
values to JSON types as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented as a Number type.
          </li>
          <li>
Boolean values SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Unordered sets of values SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sets of properties SHOULD be represented as an Object type.
          </li>
          <li>
Empty values SHOULD be represented as a null value.
          </li>
          <li>
Other values MUST be represented as a String type.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
JSON-LD
      </h2>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. The
syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using
JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily
intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments,
to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based
storage engines.
        </p>

        <p>
JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this specification.
Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in the same way they are
encoded in JSON (see Section <a href="#json"></a>), with the addition of the
<code>@context</code> property. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are designed
such that developers can copy and paste examples into their software systems.
The design goal of this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while
still ensuring global interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software
systems. This section describes some of these approaches, which will likely go
unnoticed by most developers, but whose details will be of interest to
implementers. Noteworthy features provided by JSON-LD are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
          </li>
          <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
          </li>
          <li>
The <code>@protected</code> properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure
that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means that
as long as the same <code>@context</code> declaration is made at the top of a
<a>DID document</a>, interoperability is guaranteed between implementations
that use a JSON-LD processor and implementations that do not.
          </li>

DID Methods
    </h1>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>
DID Method Schemes
      </h2>

      <p>
A <a>DID method</a> specification MUST define exactly one method-specific
<a>DID scheme</a>, identified by exactly one method name. For more information,
see the <code>method-name</code> rule in Section
<a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Because the method name is part of the <a>DID</a>, short method names are
preferred; the method name SHOULD be five characters or less. The method name
might reflect the name of the <a>DID registry</a> to which the <a>DID method</a>
specification applies. For more information, see Section
<a href="#unique-did-method-names"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification for the method-specific <a>DID scheme</a>
MUST specify how to generate the <code>method-specific-id</code> component of a
<a>DID</a>. The <code>method-specific-id</code> value MUST be able to be
generated without the use of a centralized registry service. The
<code>method-specific-id</code> value SHOULD be globally unique by itself. The
<a>DID</a>, as defined by the <code>did</code> rule in Section
<a href="#generic-did-syntax"></a>, MUST be globally unique.
      </p>

      <p>
If needed, a method-specific <a>DID scheme</a> MAY define multiple
<code>method-specific-id</code> formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a
method-specific <a>DID scheme</a> define as few <code>method-specific-id</code>
formats as possible.

      <h2>
DID Operations
      </h2>

      <p>
To enable the full functionality of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> on a
particular <a>DID registry</a>, a <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify
how each of the following <abbr title="Create, Read, Update, Delete">CRUD</abbr>
operations is performed by a client. Specify each operation to the level of
detail necessary to build and test interoperable client implementations with the
<a>DID registry</a>. These operations can effectively be used to perform all the
operations required of a CKMS (cryptographic key management system). For
example, key registration, key replacement, key rotation, key recovery, and key
expiration.

      </p>
      <p>
Any <a>DID method</a> specification that does not support a specific operation,
such as update or deactivate, MUST clearly state these limitations.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
Create
        </h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a client creates a
<a>DID</a> and its associated <a>DID document</a> on the <a>DID registry</a>,
including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control.

Read/Verify
        </h3>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
Update
        </h3>

operations necessary to establish proof of control, <em>or</em> state that
updates are not possible.

Deactivate
        </h3>

        <p>
The <a>DID method</a> specification MUST specify how a client can deactivate a

necessary to establish proof of deactivation, <em>or</em> state that
deactivation is not possible.

      <h2>
Unique DID Method Names

      <p>
The authors of a new <a>DID method</a> specification SHOULD use a method name
that is unique among all <a>DID method</a> names known to them at the time of
publication.
      </p>
      <p>
Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving
<a>DID method</a> names, there is no way to know for certain if a specific
<a>DID method</a> name is unique. To help with this challenge, the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>
maintains a non-authoritative list of known <a>DID method</a> names and their

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is a tool for implementors to use when coming to
consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for software
developers implementing <a>DID resolvers</a> for different <a>DID methods</a>.
For more information about <a>DID resolvers</a> see Section
<a href="#did-resolvers"></a>. The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is not a definitive
or official list of <a>DID methods</a>. Nonetheless, adding <a>DID method</a>
names to the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is encouraged so that other implementors
and members of the community have a place to see an overview of existing

Security Considerations

    <p class="note" title="Note to implementers">
During the Implementer’s Draft stage, this
section focuses on security topics that should be important in early
implementations. The editors are also seeking feedback on threats and
threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. As the root identifier records for <a>decentralized
identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a>DID documents</a> are a vital component of
<a>decentralized identity management</a>. They are also the foundational
building blocks of <a>decentralized public key infrastructure</a> (DPKI)
as an augmentation to conventional X.509 certificates. As such, <a>DIDs</a> are
designed to operate under the general Internet threat model used by
many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints, but allow
messages to be read or corrupted on the network. Protecting against an
attack when a system is compromised requires external key-signing
hardware. See also Section <a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a>
regarding key revocation and recovery. For their part, the <a>DLTs</a> hosting
<a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> have special security properties for preventing
active attacks. Their design uses public/private key cryptography to
allow operation on passively monitored networks without risking
compromise of private keys. This is what makes <a>DID</a> architecture and
decentralized identity possible.

Requirements of DID Method Specifications

      <p>
The requirements for <a>DID method</a> specifications are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Security Considerations
section.
        </li>

        <li>
This section MUST consider all the requirements mentioned in Section 5 of
[[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the <a>DID</a> operations defined in the
specification. In particular:

      <p class="issue">
Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to
move Authorization to <a>DID method</a> specifications. It is currently
expected that there will be an attempt to create a generalized
authorization mechanism that is build on object capabilities.
      </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
            </li>
            <li>
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well. 
            </li>
            <li>
If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, clearly
indicate which portions of the data are protected and what the protections are.
For example, integrity only, confidentiality, endpoint authentication, and so
on.
            </li>
            <li>
Give an indication to what sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is
susceptible. 
            </li>
            <li>
Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on) is to
be clearly labeled.
            </li>
            <li>
If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host
authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly
specified.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
This section MUST discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such as
the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or
cipher) after threat mitigation was deployed.
        </li>

        <li>
This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all
operations required by Section <a href="#did-operations"></a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Where <a>DID methods</a> make use of peer-to-peer computing resources, such as
with all known <a>DLTs</a>, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be
discussed in relation to denial of service.
        </li>

        <li>
Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where
<a>DID methods</a> make use of <a>DLTs</a> with varying network topology,
sometimes offered as <em>light node</em> or
<em><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security">thin client</a></em>
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the <a>DID method</a> MUST be
discussed.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which <a>DIDs</a> are
proven to be uniquely assigned. A <a>DID</a> fits the functional definition
of a URN, as defined in [[RFC8141]]. That is, a <a>DID</a> is a persistent
identifier that is assigned once to a resource and never reassigned to a
different resource. This is particularly important in a security context because
a <a>DID</a> might be used to identify a specific party subject to a specific
set of authorization rights.
        </li>

        <li>
<a>DID methods</a> that introduce new authentication <a>service endpoint</a>
types (see Section <a href="#service-endpoints"></a>) SHOULD consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.

Binding of Identity

      <section>
        <h3>
Proving Control of a DID and DID Document
        </h3>

        <p>
Signatures are one way to allow <a>DID documents</a> to be cryptographically
verifiable.
        </p>

        <p>
By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed <a>DID document</a> does not
prove control of a <a>DID</a>. It only proves that the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>DID document</a> was not tampered with since it was registered.
          </li>

          <li>
<a>DID controller(s)</a> controlled the private key used for the signature at
the time the signature was generated.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Proving control of a <a>DID</a>, that is, the binding between the <a>DID</a> and
the <a>DID document</a> that describes it, requires a two step process:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Resolving the <a>DID</a> to a <a>DID document</a> according to its
<a>DID method</a> specification.
          </li>

          <li>
Verifying that the <code>id</code> property of the resulting <a>DID document</a>
matches the <a>DID</a> that was resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It should be noted that this process proves control of a <a>DID</a> and
<a>DID document</a> regardless of whether the <a>DID document</a> is signed.
        </p>

        <p>
Signatures on <a>DID documents</a> are optional. <a>DID method</a>
specifications SHOULD explain and specify their implementation if applicable.
        </p>

        <p>
It is good practice to combine timestamps with signatures.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
Proving Control of a Public Key
        </h3>

        <p>
There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to a
<a>public key description</a> in the <a>DID document</a>: static and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
The static method is to sign the <a>DID document</a> with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the
<a>DID document</a> was registered. If the <a>DID document</a> is not signed,
control of a public key described in the <a>DID document</a> can still be proven
dynamically as follows:
        </p>

        <ol start="1">
          <li>
Send a challenge message containing a <a>public key description</a> from the
<a>DID document</a> and a nonce to an appropriate <a>service endpoint</a>
described in the <a>DID document</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
Verify the signature of the response message against the
<a>public key description</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>
Authentication and Verifiable Claims
        </h3>

        <p>
A <a>DID</a> and <a>DID document</a> do not inherently carry any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">PII</a>
(personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a <a>DID</a> to
something in the real world, such as a person or a company, for example with
credentials with the same subject as that <a>DID</a>, is out of scope for this
specification. For more information, see the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] instead.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Authentication Service Endpoints
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID document</a> publishes a <a>service endpoint</a> intended for
authentication or authorization of the <a>DID subject</a> (see Section
<a href="#service-endpoints"></a>), it is the responsibility of the
<a>service endpoint</a> provider, subject, or relying party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that
<a>service endpoint</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Non-Repudiation
      </h2>

      <p>
Non-repudiation of <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> updates is supported
under the assumption that the subject:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section
<a href="#notification-of-did-document-changes"></a>).
        </li>
        <li>
Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the 
access control mechanism for the <a>DID method</a> (see Section
<a href="#authentication"></a>).

      <h2>
Notification of DID Document Changes
      </h2>

      <p>
One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a <a>DID document</a> is
monitoring and actively notifying the <a>DID subject</a> when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file. In the case of a <a>DID</a>, where there is no intermediary
registrar or account provider to generate the notification, the following
approaches are suggested:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Subscriptions. If the <a>DID registry</a> on which the <a>DID</a> is registered
directly supports change notifications, this service can be offered to
<a>DID controllers</a>. Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant
<a>service endpoints</a> listed in an existing <a>DID</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Self-monitoring. A <a>DID subject</a> can employ their own local or online agent
to periodically monitor for changes to a <a>DID document</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
Third-party monitoring. A <a>DID subject</a> could rely on a third-party
monitoring service, however this introduces another vector of attack.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key and Signature Expiration
      </h2>

      <p>
In a <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore
<a>DID resolvers</a> and other client applications need to validate that keys
were not expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases might have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure a key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key, and implementations
of a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Key Revocation and Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#did-operations"></a> specifies the <a>DID</a> operations to be
supported by a <a>DID method</a> specification, including deactivation of a
<a>DID document</a> by replacing it with an updated <a>DID document</a>. In
general, checking for key revocation on <a>DLT</a>-based methods is expected to
be handled in a manner similar to checking the balance of a cryptocurrency
account on a <a>distributed ledger</a>. That is, if the balance is empty, the
entire <a>DID</a> is deactivated. <a>DID method</a> specifications are expected
to enable support for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key recovery. Some
of the facilities to do so are suggested in Section
<a href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>. Not all <a>DID method</a>
specifications will recognize control from <a>DIDs</a> registered using other
<a>DID methods</a> and they might restrict third-party control to <a>DIDs</a>
that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a <a>DID method</a>
specification can also include a time lock feature to protect against key
compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further
specification of this type of control is a matter for future work (see Section
<a href="#time-locks-and-did-document-recovery"></a>).

      <h2>
The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
      </h2>

      <p>
<a>DIDs</a> achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability.
The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
demonstrates the axiom about identifiers described in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko's Triangle</a>:
"human-meaningful, decentralized, secure &mdash; pick any two".
      </p>

      <p>
There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to
discover a <a>DID</a> when starting from a human-friendly identifier. For
example, a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for
a <a>DID controller</a>, such as a mobile telephone number, email address,
Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly
identifiers to <a>DIDs</a> (and doing so in a way that can be verified and
trusted) is outside the scope of this specification.
      </p>

      <p>
Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate
specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended
that such specifications carefully consider the:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.
        </li>
        <li>
Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
        </li>
      <ul>

      <p class="note">
A draft specification for discovering a <a>DID</a> from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[DNS-DID]].

        <h2>
Immutability
        </h2>

        <p>
Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the <a>DID</a>
ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this specification is
focused on a data model instead of a protocol, it offers no opinion about many
aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual <a>DID methods</a>
might want to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics
they do not need. The more <em>locked down</em> a <a>DID method</a> is, while
providing the same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious
actors.
        </p>
        <p>
As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with respect
to updating. A single edit to a <a>DID document</a> can change anything and
everything except the root <code>id</code> property of the document. And any
individual JSON object in the data model can change all of its properties except
its <code>id</code>. But is it actually desirable for a <a>service endpoint</a>
to change its <code>type</code> after it is defined? Or for a key to change its
value? Or would it be better to require a new <code>id</code> when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a web site
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its identifier (the host name),
but gets subtle, dangerous changes underneath. If certain properties of the site
were required by the specification to be immutable (for example, the
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>
associated with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more
expensive to carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.
        </p>
        <p>
The notion that immutability provides some cybersecurity benefits is
particularly relevant because of caching. For <a>DID methods</a> tied to a
global source of truth, a direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a
<a>DID document</a> is always possible. However, it seems likely that layers of
cache might eventually sit between a client and that source of truth. If they
do, believing the attributes of an object in the <a>DID document</a> to have a
given state, when they are actually subtly different, might invite exploits.
This is particularly true if some lookups are of a full <a>DID document</a>, and
others are of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

    <h1>
Privacy Considerations
    </h1>

    <p>
It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
to all aspects of decentralized identifier architecture, because DIDs
and DID Documents are &mdash; by design &mdash; administered directly by
the <a>DID controller(s)</a>.
There is no registrar, hosting company, or other intermediate service
provider to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The
authors of this specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design
principles throughout its development. For example, privacy in this
specification is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an embedded
default. Furthermore, <a>decentralized identifier</a> architecture by itself
embodies principle #7, "Respect for user privacy &mdash; keep it user-centric."
This section lists additional privacy considerations that implementers,
delegates, and <a>DID subjects</a> should bear in mind.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
Requirements of DID Method Specifications
      </h2>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MUST include their own Privacy
Considerations sections, if only to point to the general privacy
considerations in this section.
        </li>

        <li>
The <a>DID method</a> specification's Privacy Considerations section
MUST discuss any subsection of
section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific
manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data
compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, exclusion.

      <h2>
Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private
      </h2>

      <p>
If a <a>DID method</a> specification is written for a public <a>DID
registry</a> where all <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> will be publicly available,
it is <em>critical</em> that <a>DID documents</a> contain no PII. All PII
should be kept behind <a>service endpoints</a> under the control
of the <a>DID subject</a>. With this privacy architecture, PII may be exchanged
on a private, peer-to-peer basis using communications channels identified and
secured by <a>public key descriptions</a> in <a>DID documents</a>. This also
enables <a>DID subjects</a> and relying parties to implement the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">right
to be forgotten</a>, as no PII will be written to an immutable
<a>distributed ledger</a>.

      <h2>
DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs
      </h2>

      <p>
Like any type of globally unique identifier, <a>DIDs</a> may be used for
correlation. <a>DID controllers</a> can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise unique <a>DIDs</a>, i.e., by sharing a different private <a>DID</a> for
every relationship. In effect, each <a>DID</a> acts as a pseudonym. A
pseudonymous <a>DID</a> need only be shared with more than one party when
the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly authorizes correlation between those parties.
If pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are the default, then the only need for a public
<a>DID</a> &mdash; a <a>DID</a> published openly or shared with a large number of
parties &mdash; is when the <a>DID subject</a> explicitly desires public identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
DID Document Correlation Risks
      </h2>

      <p>
The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous <a>DIDs</a> are easily
defeated if the data in the corresponding <a>DID documents</a> can be
correlated. For example, using same <a>public key descriptions</a> or
bespoke <a>service endpoints</a> in multiple <a>DID documents</a> can provide
as much correlation information as using the same <a>DID</a>. Therefore the <a>DID
document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a> also needs to use pairwise-unique
public keys.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise-unique <a>service endpoints</a>
in the <a>DID document</a> for a pseudonymous <a>DID</a>. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between to <a>DIDs</a> to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy may be to share an
endpoint among thousands or millions of <a>DIDs</a> controlled by many different
subjects.

    <section>
      <h2>
Herd Privacy
      </h2>

      <p>
When a <a>DID subject</a> is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy
is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party
is by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. <a>DIDs</a>
and <a>DID methods</a> need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for
those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human
interfaces that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. In
order to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">digital
fingerprints</a>, share common settings across client
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire
protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

Future Work

    <section>
      <h2>
Upper Limits on DID Character Length
      </h2>

      <p>
The current specification does not take a position on maximum length
of a <a>DID</a>. The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K
characters. QR codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using
<a>DIDs</a> will be responsible for storing many <a>DIDs</a>, and some methods
would be able to externalize some of their costs onto clients by
relying on more complicated signature schemes or by adding state into
<a>DIDs</a> intended for temporary use. A future version of this
specification should set reasonable limits on <a>DID</a> character length to
minimize externalities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Equivalence
      </h2>

      <p>
Including an equivalence property, such as <code>equivID</code>, in <a>DID documents</a>
whose value is an array of <a>DIDs</a> would allow subjects to assert two or
more <a>DIDs</a> that represent the same subject. This capability has
numerous uses, including supporting migration between <a>DID registries</a> and
providing forward compatibility of existing <a>DIDs</a> to future <a>DID
registries</a>. In
theory, equivalent <a>DIDs</a> should have the same identifier rights,
allowing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable claims</a>
made against one <a>DID</a> to apply to equivalent <a>DIDs</a>. Equivalence was not
included in the current specification due to the complexity of
verifying equivalence across different <a>DLTs</a> and different <a>DID
methods</a>, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent <a>DID
documents</a>. However equivalence should be supported in a future
version of this specification.

      <h2>
Timestamps
      </h2>

      <p>
Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identifier
records. This is a good fit for <a>DLTs</a>, since most offer some type of
timestamp mechanism. Despite some transactional cost, they are the
most censorship-resistant transaction ordering systems in the world,
so they are nearly ideal for <a>DID document</a> timestamping. In some cases
a <a>DLT</a>'s immediate timing is approximate, however their sense of
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract">
"median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP 113)</a> can be precisely
defined. A generic <a>DID document</a> timestamping mechanism could would
work across all <a>DLTs</a> and might operate via a mechanism including
either individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic
mechanism was deemed out of scope for this version, although it may
be included in a future version of this specification.

      <h2>
Time Locks and DID Document Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a> mentions one
possible clever use of time locks to recover control of a <a>DID</a> after a
key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override the
most recent update to a <a>DID document</a> with Authorization applied by an
earlier version of the <a>DID document</a> in order to defeat the attacker.
This protection depends on adding a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract">
time lock (see Bitcoin BIP 65)</a> to protect part of the transaction
chain, enabling a Authorization block to be used to recover control.
We plan to add support for time locks in a future version of this
specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Smart Signatures
      </h2>

      <p>
Not all <a>DLTs</a> can support the Authorization logic in section
<a href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>.
Therefore, in this version of the specification, all Authorization
logic is delegated to <a>DID method</a> specifications. A potential
future solution is a <a href="http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf">Smart
Signature</a> specification that specifies the code any conformant
<a>DLT</a> may implement to process signature control logic.

    <section>
      <h2>
Verifiable Claims
      </h2>

      <p>
Although <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> form a foundation for decentralized
identity, they are only the first step in describing their subjects. The
rest of the descriptive power comes through collecting and
selectively using <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vctf/">verifiable
claims</a>. Future versions of the specification will describe in
more detail how <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID document</a> can be integrated with &mdash; and help
enable &mdash; the verifiable claims ecosystem.

    <section>
      <h2>
Alternate Serializations and Graph Models
      </h2>

      <p>
This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph
model for expressing a <a>DID document</a>. Future versions of this
specification might specify other semantic graph formats for a <a>DID
document</a>.
